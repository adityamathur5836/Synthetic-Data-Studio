# Project Vision: SyntheticData Studio

## The Problem
Access to high-quality, diverse medical data is the primary bottleneck in healthcare AI. Privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR), data silos, and the high cost of annotation stifle innovation. Researchers often spend months just getting access to data before they can start training models.

## Our Solution
SyntheticData Studio leverages state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create unlimited, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets. These datasets preserve the statistical relevance needed for training robust AI models but contain no real patient data.

## Core Values
1.  **Privacy First**: We believe patient privacy is paramount and should never be compromised.
2.  **Open Science**: We aim to provide tools that lower the barrier to entry for medical AI research.
3.  **Quality**: Synthetic data must be rigorously validated to ensure it is useful for real-world applications.

## Roadmap
-   **Phase 1 (Hackathon MVP)**: Basic GAN for retinal scans, web interface for generation and download.
-   **Phase 2**: Support for X-rays and MRI, improved GAN architecture (StyleGAN2/3).
-   **Phase 3**: API for programmatic access, dataset versioning, differential privacy guarantees.
